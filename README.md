## Project Description

`[Product_Name]` is a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) built with Flutter. It acts as an AI assistant for farmers and gardeners, helping them diagnose potential crop diseases or issues by analyzing images uploaded or captured through the app. The system uses Firebase for backend infrastructure (Storage, Functions) and a TensorFlow model for image analysis. Its purpose is to provide accessible and rapid diagnostic support for better plant health management.

This project utilizes AI for image recognition and aligns with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger)** by aiming to reduce crop losses through timely diagnosis.

## Problem Statement

Farmers and gardeners often struggle to quickly and accurately identify plant diseases, pests, or nutrient deficiencies based solely on visual symptoms. This diagnostic challenge can lead to delayed or incorrect treatments, resulting in reduced crop yields, economic losses, and inefficient resource use. Access to expert agronomic advice is often limited or not immediately available.

## Solution

`[Product_Name]` addresses these challenges by providing an easy-to-use mobile application that:

*   Allows users to select their crop type and provide an image of the plant concern.
*   Securely uploads the image to Firebase Storage.
*   Triggers a Firebase Function that uses a TensorFlow (TF Lite) model to analyze the image.
*   Retrieves relevant advice/treatment information (potentially from Firestore).
*   Presents the diagnosis prediction, confidence level, and actionable advice to the user in a simple chat interface.

## Features

*   Crop selection interface.
*   Image capture via device camera.
*   Image upload from device gallery.
*   Firebase Storage integration for image uploads.
*   AI-powered image analysis via Firebase Functions and TensorFlow Lite.
*   Display of diagnosis (prediction), confidence score, and advice.
*   Simple chat-like interface for results.
*   Cross-platform (iOS & Android) support via Flutter.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Flutter, Dart
*   **State Management:** Provider
*   **Image Handling:** `image_picker` package
*   **Backend:** Firebase
    *   **Authentication:** (Optional, if added) Firebase Authentication
    *   **Storage:** Firebase Storage (for image uploads)
    *   **Compute:** Firebase Functions (Node.js/Python/Go - Specify language used) - Hosting TF Lite model & logic
    *   **Database:** (Optional, if used for advice/history) Cloud Firestore
*   **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow / TensorFlow Lite
*   **API Calls (Flutter -> Function):** `http` package (if using `onRequest` Functions) OR `cloud_functions` package (if using `onCall` Functions)
*   **Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (underlying Firebase services)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (Latest stable version recommended)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended, required for Firebase CLI and JS Functions)
*   [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli): `npm install -g firebase-tools`
*   Firebase Project: Create a project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
*   Editor/IDE: VS Code, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA with Flutter plugins.
*   Target Device or Emulator.

### Frontend (Flutter)

1.  **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Name]/frontend # Or root if flutter code is there
    ```
2.  **Configure Firebase:**
    *   Ensure you have the correct `firebase_options.dart` file in `lib/`. If not, run `flutterfire configure` and select your Firebase project.
    *   Make sure `android/app/google-services.json` and `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` are correctly placed (download from Firebase project settings).
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    *(Ensure a device is connected or an emulator is running)*

### Backend (Firebase Functions)

1.  **Navigate to Functions Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../functions # Or the correct path to your functions code
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # Or pip install -r requirements.txt for Python
    ```
3.  **Set up Firebase Project Link (if needed):**
    ```bash
    firebase use [your-firebase-project-id]
    ```
4.  **Deploy Functions:**
    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only functions
    ```
    *(Ensure you are logged into the Firebase CLI: `firebase login`)*
5.  **(If using HTTP onRequest Function):** Note the deployed function URL. Ensure it matches the URL used in the Flutter `FirebaseService`.

### ML Model

1.  The TensorFlow Lite model (`model.tflite` or similar name) should typically be deployed *with* the Firebase Function. Place it within the `functions/` directory (or a subdirectory) so the function code can access it.
2.  If you have separate model training code (`ml/` directory), follow instructions within that directory to potentially retrain or export the model.

## Usage

1.  Launch the `[Product_Name]` app on your device/emulator.
2.  Select the type of crop you want to analyze from the list.
3.  On the next screen, either capture a new photo of the plant using the camera icon or upload an existing photo using the gallery icon.
4.  Press the proceed button.
5.  Wait for the image to upload and the analysis to complete (loading indicators will show).
6.  View the diagnosis results (prediction, confidence, advice) presented in the chat interface.

## Challenges Faced

*   **Model Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy across various lighting conditions, camera angles, and disease stages is challenging. Model requires diverse training data.
*   **Integration:** Ensuring smooth data flow between Flutter app -> Firebase Storage -> Firebase Functions -> TensorFlow Model -> Back to App.
*   **Real-time Performance:** Optimizing image upload and function execution time for a responsive user experience.
*   **Firebase Rules:** Configuring appropriate security rules for Firebase Storage (and Firestore, if used) to allow user uploads while preventing unauthorized access.
*   **(If applicable):** Cold starts in Firebase Functions impacting initial response time.

## Future Work

*   Implement user authentication (Firebase Auth).
*   Store diagnosis history per user (Firestore).
*   Improve the ML model with more data and advanced architectures.
*   Support a wider variety of crops and diseases.
*   Integrate location data (optional) for regional disease tracking.
*   Add multi-language support.
*   Implement a more interactive chat flow allowing follow-up questions.
*   Refine UI/UX based on user feedback.
